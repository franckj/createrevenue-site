# createrevenue-site: Claude Code instructions

B2B sales coaching website for Brendan McAdams. Built with Astro, deployed on Cloudflare Pages, with an email-to-publish workflow powered by Cloudflare Email Workers and Claude API.

Part of Franck's portfolio. Cross-project context (rules, access, decisions) lives in `franckj/ops`: read its `BA-STATE.md` first when you need it.

## At the start of a session
`git pull`, then read: `README.md`.

## Commands
- `npm run build`: `astro build && npx pagefind --site dist`
- `npm run dev`: `astro dev`
- `npm run preview`: `astro preview`

## Rules
- Franck prompts, Claude Code builds. Be direct.
- **A deploy needs Franck's word** ("deploy") in the session. Pushing to `main` can ship; building and committing do not.
- No invented facts, numbers, prices or reviews: every figure comes from a source you checked, or it stays out.
- Never commit keys, tokens, `.env` files or credentials. Name a secret by its variable name only.
- After a live page change: submit the changed URLs (IndexNow) and resubmit the sitemap, as described in `franckj/ops`.
- Update the docs you changed or whose state changed before ending a session, then commit and push.
