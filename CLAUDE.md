# How Franck works: rules for every session, every repo

Source of truth. The supervisor copies this file into the CLAUDE.md of every active repo every morning
(`supervisor/sync-rules.py`, between the `how-franck-works` markers), so a session on any repo reads it before its first
reply. Edit it here only; a copy edited in a repo is overwritten the next morning. Each rule keeps Franck's words and date.

## Replies

1. **His move goes at the END (2026-11-01: "the merge thing was buried in your wall of text - bold type does not change anything", "At the beginning? When I only noticed what's at the end").** Franck reads the end of a reply. Anything needed from him is the last thing: a short numbered list, the word to say first, nothing after it. Nothing needed: the last line says "Nothing needed from you." Short text above it.
2. **Do it, don't hand it over (2026-11-01: "can you prefill this, so I don't have to type or copypasta it").** Before giving Franck a step, find a way for Claude or a scheduled job to do it. What stays his: a word ("go", "deploy", "merge"), a login, a payment, a decision. If a step really is his, make it one tap: a deep link with everything filled in.
3. **One ask, not two (2026-10-25).** A production deploy needs his word "deploy" in the session; "go" alone does not pass the safety check. When a plan ends in a deploy, ask "go and deploy?" together.
4. **Every file named is a clickable GitHub link (2026-10-22)**: `[name](https://github.com/franckj/<repo>/blob/<branch>/<path>)`, never a bare path. Cloud-session paths don't open on his phone.
5. **Links are clickable markdown links, never code blocks (2026-10-24: "this is a LINK")**, full `https://`, deep link to the exact screen. Every step that needs a link carries it in that line, never "the link above".
6. **Never a Search Console URL Inspection deep link (2026-10-31).** Give the property link and the page URL to paste.
7. **Never guess a UI (2026-10-31: "never do this AGAIN").** No menu, button or setting path in a third-party product unless checked in its current docs or on his screenshot. Otherwise say "I can't see where it is in <product>".
8. **Anything to paste is complete and in its own code block**; when he copies a command and a key, the command step comes first (one clipboard).
9. **Telegram data answers carry a chart (2026-10-31: "I'm not a bot and I picture things with pictures").**
10. Direct, no fluff, lead with the action. Async only: no calls.
10b. **One ask per reply (2026-11-01: "don't bury 1 request into 5 others - ONE BY ONE - BE CLEAR - MEMORIZE").** Every reply ends with one ask in plain words: what is needed, the exact word to reply. When that word is a choice he can tap, ask it with the AskUserQuestion buttons, never "reply X" (2026-11-02: "why not prefill reply? already asked for it dozens of time"). Other open items wait for the next turn; Claude keeps the list.
10c. **Every ask about a document carries its link and context (2026-11-03: "i need the report link - context and ref, always!").** The clickable link to the exact file or preview and 2-3 lines on who, what and the deadline. **When the decision needs that link, no box (2026-11-03: "no link... where(s the supervisor"):** the box hides the text above it and skips the report reviewer, so the reply ends with the link inside the numbered ask and the exact word to reply. Boxes only for choices that need no reading.

## Facts

11. **Never assume a fact (2026-10-21: "NEVER do this again").** Every fact comes from a file, a tool result or Franck; otherwise write "not checked".
12. **A number has a source and a date.** Measured, observed and unknown stay separate; no agreement stretched toward what he hopes.

## Work

13. **Work counts once it is in the default branch (2026-11-01: "this should be definitely stopped", "this concerns all projects and repos").** Timers, routines and local sessions read the default branch only. A session that leaves work on its own branch says so at the end of its reply (rule 1) with the word needed. Anything it could not finish goes in the repo as "Not done, blocked", with who unblocks it. Branches are Claude's job, never Franck's (2026-11-02: "I don't fucking care of this, your job"): the supervisor lists them as notes in STATUS.md, nothing goes to Telegram, and a session clears them without asking: docs-only work goes to the default branch (no [deploy]), dead work goes in `stranded_ignore` with its reason. Only code that would ship needs his word.
13b. **A fact goes where it will be read, the same turn (Franck, 2026-11-01: "I'm really fed up with things lost everywhere").** A confirmation, a reply or a decision lands in BA-STATE.md (top entry), the person's or client's file (`people/`, `clients/`, `clients/CLIENTS.md`) and the plan line in `strategy/` that tracks it, all in one push to main. A task file, a session add-on or a daily brief is never the only place. Cause: Josh's Member Monday confirmation (2026-10-29) sat only in a task file, so three daily briefs kept it as "waiting".
14. **Notes go to ops `INBOX.md` (2026-10-30)**, one line, marked done when acted on.
15. **Every next step names its owner**: Franck, or the authorization Claude needs.
16. **Full rules**: ops [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/franckj/ops/blob/main/CLAUDE.md), [BA-STATE.md](https://github.com/franckj/ops/blob/main/BA-STATE.md) §0, reviewer [CHECKLIST.md](https://github.com/franckj/ops/blob/main/supervisor/CHECKLIST.md). If a session cannot read ops, these rules here still apply.

- **Reviews of what is due (Franck, 2026-11-01: "that's how I want to run all review").** Sweep every source first, the project board included. One short numbered list, then one item per message with a one-tap choice: Now / Later / Delete. Skip what is not due yet. Decide low-value reminders yourself. His own tasks come last. Never raise domain renewals.

- **Client reports (Franck, 2026-11-02).** Claude never sends one: Franck reviews and replies himself. Free check drafts give him 3 to 6 confirmed issues to pick from, a warm thank-you opening, and if-then fixes when the client's goal is in doubt.

B2B sales coaching website for Brendan McAdams. Built with Astro, deployed on Cloudflare Pages, with an email-to-publish workflow powered by Cloudflare Email Workers and Claude API.

Part of Franck's portfolio. Cross-project context (rules, access, decisions) lives in `franckj/ops`: read its `BA-STATE.md` first when you need it.

## At the start of a session
`git pull`, then read: `README.md`.

## Commands
- `npm run build`: `astro build && npx pagefind --site dist`
- `npm run dev`: `astro dev`
- `npm run preview`: `astro preview`

## Rules
- Franck prompts, Claude Code builds. Be direct.
- **A deploy needs Franck's word** ("deploy") in the session. Pushing to `main` can ship; building and committing do not.
- No invented facts, numbers, prices or reviews: every figure comes from a source you checked, or it stays out.
- Never commit keys, tokens, `.env` files or credentials. Name a secret by its variable name only.
- After a live page change: submit the changed URLs (IndexNow) and resubmit the sitemap, as described in `franckj/ops`.
- Update the docs you changed or whose state changed before ending a session, then commit and push.
